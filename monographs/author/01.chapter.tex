\section{INTRODUCTION}
A satisfactory discussion of the main concepts of analysis (such as convergence, continuity, differentiation, and integration) 
must be based on an accurately defined number concept. We shall not, however, enter into any discussion of 
the axioms that govern the arithmetic of the integers, but assume familiarity with the rational numbers 
(i.e., the numbers of the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n\not=0$).\\
The rational number system is inadequate for many purposes, both as a field and as an ordered set. (These terms will 
be defined in Secs. ~\ref{to be added} and ~\ref{to be added}.) For instance, there is no rational $p$ such that 
$p^2=2$. (We shall prove this presently.) This leads to the introduction of so-called ``irrational numbers'' 
which are often written as infinite decimal expansions and are considered to be ``approximated'' by the corresponding 
finite decimals. Thus the sequence
\begin{equation*}
    1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, \dots
\end{equation*}
``tends to $\sqrt{2}$.'' But unless the irrational number $\sqrt{2}$ has been clearly defined, the question must arise: 
Just what is it that this sequence ``tends to''?\\
\indent This sort of question can be answered as soon as the so-called ``real number system'' is constructed.

\subsection*{\textbf{Example}}
\label{subsec:1}
We now show that the equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:01}
    p^2=2
\end{equation}
is not satisfied by any rational $p$. If there were such a $p$, we could write $p=\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ 
are integers that are not both even. Let us assume this is done. Then ~\ref{eq:01} implies
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:02}
    m^2=2n^2,
\end{equation}
This shows that $m^2$ is even. Hence $m$ is even (if $m$ were odd, $m^2$ would be odd), and so $m^2$ is divisible by $4$.
It follows that the right side of ~\ref{eq:02} is divisible by $4$, so that $n^2$ is even, which implies that $n$ 
is even.\\
\indent The assumption that ~\ref{eq:01} holds thus leads to the conclusion that both $m$ and $n$ are even, contrary 
to our choice of $m$ and $n$. Hence ~\ref{eq:01} is impossible for the rational $p$.\\
\indent We now examine this situation a little more closely. Let $\mathbf{A}$ be the set of all positive rationals $p$ such that $p^2 < 2$ 
and let $B$ consist of all positive rationals $p$ such that $^2 > 2$. We shall show that $\mathbf{A}$ \textit{contains no largest number and}
 $\mathbf{B}$ \textit{contains no smallest}.\\
 \indent More explicitly, for every $p$ in $\mathbf{A}$ we can find a rational $p$ in $\mathbf{A}$ such that 
 $p<q$, and for every $p$ in $\mathbb{B}$ we can find a rational $q$ in $\mathbf{B}$ such that $q<p$.\\
 \indent To do this, we associate with each rational $p>0$ the number
 \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:03}
    q=p-\frac{p^2-2}{p+2}=\frac{2p+2}{p+2}
 \end{equation}
\noindent Then
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:04}
    q^2-2=\frac{2(p^2-2)}{(p+2)^2}
\end{equation}
\indent If $p$ is in $\mathbf{A}$ then $p^2-2<0$, ~\ref{eq:03} shows that $q>p$, and ~\ref{eq:04} shows that
$q^2<2$. Thus $q$ is in $\mathbf{A}$.\\
\indent If $p$ is in $\mathbf{B}$ then $p^2-2>0$, ~\ref{eq:03} shows that $0<q<p$, and ~\ref{eq:04} shows that
$q^2>2$. Thus $q$ is in $\mathbf{B}$.



~\cite{ARTIN}

\begin{definition}
    A field is a set $F$ with two operations, called \textit{addition} and \textit{multiplication},
    which satisfy the following so-called ``field axioms'' ~\ref{AXIOMSA}, and ~\ref{AXIOMSM}, and ~\ref{AXIOMSD}:


\subsubsection*{\textbf{Axioms for addition}}
\label{AXIOMSA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x \in F$ and $y \in F$, then their sum $x+y$ is in $F$.
    \item Addition is commutative: $x+y=y+x$ for all $x,y \in F$
    \item Addition is associative: $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$ for all $x,y,z \in F$.
    \item $F$ contains an element $0$ such that $0+x=x$ for every $x \in F$.
    \item To every $x \in F$ corresponds an element $-x \in F$ such That
        \begin{equation*}
            x+(-x)=0.
        \end{equation*} 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Axioms for multiplication}}
\label{AXIOMSM}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x \in F$ and $y \in F$, then their product $xy$ is in $F$.
    \item Multiplication is commutative: $xy=yx$ for all $x,y \in F$.
    \item Multiplication is associative: $(xy)z=x(yz)$ for all $x,y,z \in F$.
    \item $F$ contains an element $1 \neq 0$ such that $1x=x$ for every $x \in F$.
    \item If $x \in F$ and $x \neq 0$ then there exists an element $1/x \in F$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        x.(1/x)=1.
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{The distributive law}}
\label{AXIOMSD}

\begin{equation*}
    x(y+z)=xy+xz
\end{equation*}
holds for all $x,y,z \in F$.
\end{definition}

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:1}
Use the template \emph{chapter.tex} together with the document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content conformable to the Springer Nature layout.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text. Furtheron please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

\eject

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects.}.
\begin{eqnarray}
\left|\nabla U_{\alpha}^{\mu}(y)\right| &\le&\frac1{d-\alpha}\int
\left|\nabla\frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha}}\right|\,d\mu(\xi) =
\int \frac1{|\xi-y|^{d-\alpha+1}} \,d\mu(\xi)\qquad  \\
&=&(d-\alpha+1) \int\limits_{d(y)}^\infty
\frac{\mu(B(y,r))}{r^{d-\alpha+2}}\,dr \le (d-\alpha+1)
